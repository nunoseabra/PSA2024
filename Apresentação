Contagem Ponteiras Soldadura 

2. SERVICEDESCRIPTION
The proposed system has the following operating mode:
- User identification through RFID;
- Placement of used tips in a specific input;
- Identification of welding tips and calculation of the quantity of tips to be supplied, through the weight of the scale;
- Dispensing with welding tips;
- Possibility of supplying additional tips, through previous configuration in the software; - The used tips are pushed to a collection place, through a linear actuator;
The system consists of:
- Supply of a structure in aluminum profile and closed with polycarbonate or equivalent, for mounting the computer, scale, screw dispensers, among others. At the rear, there will be an access door with a lock, for replacing tips in the dispensers' deposits, removing used tips and carrying out maintenance;
- Computer (Server) with integrated touch-screen monitor, for:
- User identification;
- Operator interaction with the system;
- Possibility of remote access, to monitor the system's operating status,
- Preparation of data reports: by date (range of dates), by type of tip, by operator, by line, etc.;
- System configuration: Operator registration, weekly and daily production planning (defining consumption limits per line, operator, type of tip, etc);

    
     
- Electric panel, consisting of:
- Protection circuit breakers;
- Differential switch;
- Digital input and output module, to interface with the various components (Dispensers, Linear Actuator, flags);
- RFID card reading station, for user identification;
- Scale (up to 1Kg and 0.1g resolution) with serial communication, for:
- Weigh the welding tips,
- Identification of the type of tip,
- Calculation of the number of tips;
- (Qt 3) Screw dispensers (standard), for each type of tips;
- Supply of a linear actuator and support, to remove the used tips from the scale; - Deposit to store used tips;
